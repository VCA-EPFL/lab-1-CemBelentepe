3.  Shifters

>> If shftAmnt is dynamic (nonconstant), count the number of selectors (and their size) of naiveShfl(in, shftAmnt)
  It will create a 16-to-1 MUX, selected by the `shftAmnt`, where each selection and the output has the type of Vector#(16, Bit#(16)) which is 256 bits.

>> If shftAmnt is constant (for example 0b0100), count the number of selectors (and their size) of naiveShfl(in, shftAmnt).
  Shifting by a constant amount does not require any selectors, it is just wire connections. The size of the wire would be 16*16=256 bits.

>> Count the number of selectors (and their size) of your barrel shifter
  When the loop unrolled, it will have four 2-to-1 MUXs back to back, each carrying the signal with type Vector#(16, Bit#(16))
